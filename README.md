# EnrollHelper
Because when need to enroll/arrange new sem class. Always fuck me up because the time will clash. So i want to an app to help me arrange class.
I use flutter because i want to learn flutter, i know c# is more easy to do these logical shit.
New to flutter. Hope can done this shit. (ง •_•)ง

Basic idea:
  - input class related data.
    - can put it to essentail, not essential, 2,3,4... choose 1 shit to have more dynamic arrange.
  - can save class related data into phone.
  - generate possible schedule.
    - can show in different view, such as:
      - list
      - time table
  - mark specific schedule to wished list.
  - maybe can export?
